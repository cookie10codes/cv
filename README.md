## Introducing myself
Hi üëãüèº, I‚Äôm Stefanie (a.k.a. Stef). I‚Äôm a developer from Belgium with over 10 years of experience in development (front and back) focusing on Craft CMS. Creating new projects from scratch is my all-time favourite thing to do, job-wise of course üòâ... 

I'm tempted to add "Digital Fire Fighter" to my job role, as this is also part of being a developer‚Äîbeing able to fix issues and keep the clients happy. As a person, I like to be organised, and communication is one of my top priorities. I like to keep everything clean and clear, so stress levels are optimal. Humour is a part of my life; I find joy in my daily tasks and I'm always up for a laugh. But if needed, I can be serious and straight to the point.

Over the years I became an expert in scalable solutions within the Craft CMS environment. I master the Atomic Design Principles allowing me to take maintainability / scalability / onboarding to the next level.
