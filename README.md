## Introducing myself
Hi üëãüèº , I‚Äôm Stefanie (a.k.a Stef), I‚Äôm a developer from Belgium with +10 years experience in development (front and back) focussing on Craft CMS. Creating new projects from scratch is my all-time favourite thing to do, job wise of course... I still have a life outside of work üòÇ. I'm tempted to add "Digital Fire Fighter" to my job role, as this is also part of being a developer, being able to fix issues and keeping the clients happy. As I person, I like to be organised and communication is one of my top priorities. I like to keep everything clean and clear, so stress levels are optimal. Humor is a part of my life, I find joy in my daily tasks and always in for a laugh, but if needed I can be serious and straight to the point.
